# Sportsball backend

## TODO
- start the backend with boilerplate
- figure out database
- configure openAPI account and request schema
- determine sports news API 
  - could get all team data from ESPN api and then do a news search on that
  - could just get headlines and serve major news as well as some local-type search
  - newsAPI can give major headlines, but I need to play with it to figure out how to get specific data
